    \item Memory allocation (malloc) algorithm comparisons. Which would work on hardware?
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item https://github.com/aclements/mtrace
        \item The intelligent memory allocator selector \\
        https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1477842415300075
        \item Object resizing and reclamation through the use of hardware bit-maps \\

    \item{Study on memory allocation patterns: How do different types of programs dynamically allocate? https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7828283/}
    \item "We compare five existing dynamic memory allocators optimized for GPUs and show their strengths and weaknesses" \\
    http://dcgi.felk.cvut.cz/projects/CMalloc/
    \item This guy is using malloc in his embedded system program (big no no usually) and does his own malloc + recommends some others, so that he gets less fragmentation (the RTOS one actually impedes him from using the memory fully!) -- https://github.com/dimonomid/umm\_malloc
