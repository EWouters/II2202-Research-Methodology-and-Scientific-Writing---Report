We compare three dynamic memory allocators designed for running on GPUs and select the best performing under TensorFlowâ€™s Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) benchmark, running the ResNet-50 and AlexNet models. The main metric of comparison is the number of images per second processed by the benchmark. Other metrics studied are: object sizes requested for allocation by the benchmark and the frequency in allocation request and in the sizes used. After our performance analysis, we conclude that \texttt{Halloc} algorithm is better than the already used algorithms by TensorFlow, \texttt{CUDAMalloc} and \texttt{BFCMalloc}, in the context of the benchmark itself.\footnote{Not proven yet. Might possibly also be false.}.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
%% Longer problem statement
%% General introduction to the area

Machine learning represents a major and computationally intensive computing technique that is one of the most important drivers of progress of humankind and of the technology we use today. We aim to raise the performance of such a complex programming technique by catering to one of the basic computing techniques it uses: dynamic memory allocation on graphics processing unit (GPU).

In the present research paper, we offer a comparison of the performance of several dynamic memory allocation algorithms running on the GPU, executed by a benchmark of the well-known machine learning (ML) software library TensorFlow. The benchmark constructs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) of different models: ResNet-50, AlexNet.

Different dynamic memory allocation algorithms capable to run on the GPU are selected and studied based on different factors (such as \textit{speed}, \textit{memory management} and \textit{object sizes} requested for allocation). The algorithms chosen are: \texttt{CUDAMalloc}, \texttt{BFCMalloc} and \texttt{Halloc}.

Descriptions of TensorFlow, the benchmark, the CNN models that are studied, the dynamic memory allocation algorithms selected for study and possible issues with dynamic memory allocation in general are under the sub-section \textit{\nameref{sec:theoretical-framework}} of this \textit{\nameref{sec:introduction}} section. In section \ref{sec:questions}, \textit{\nameref{sec:questions}}, it is laid out the conclusions we want to make and our expectations of the results, before running the benchmark. Most algorithms come accompanied with their own self descriptions that offer an idea in which situations such algorithms would behave better than other algorithms. Section \ref{sec:methods}, \textit{\nameref{sec:methods}}, includes the system configuration on which the the tests were executed, as well as the description of the test paradigm this study entails. Section \ref{sec:results-and-analysis}, \textit{\nameref{sec:results-and-analysis}} includes the final graphs and tables with data after an extensive run of our tests. Here, we also discuss the different aspects that such results entail: there's no one allocator that satisfies all supposed requirements. Finally, under the section \ref{sec:discussion}, \textit{\nameref{sec:discussion}}, we draw a conclusion for what allocators are the best in which cases.

\subsection{Theoretical framework}
\label{sec:theoretical-framework}

\subsubsection*{Literature study}

Although the study of different designs of implemented memory allocators for the GPU are numerous and well-documented, the research that aims comparing performance of different memory allocators for the GPU are scarce. 

The work of \citeauthor{Vinkler2015}'s study from \citeyear{Vinkler2015} does a comprehensive comparison, under the workload of \textit{k}-d tree data structures, which is used in ray tracing, to produce lighting and shadows when rendering 3D images. They select many dynamic memory allocators and integrate them into their own benchmark, as well as create their own, new dynamic memory allocator specific for their workflow. All of this is packaged in a source code provided publicly.

[To be completed]

\subsubsection*{TensorFlow}

TensorFlow is an open-source software library that can perform numerical computation using data flow graphs. It can therefore perform machine learning in a faster and easier manner, being one of its main application purposes. TensorFlow was developed and used in-house by a research team at Google, being released afterwards to the public on November 2015 on GitHub. The very first public version of TensorFlow contains parts of another deep learning project named Caffe, developed at University of California, having a copyright notice alongside, dated 2014.

Yet, ever since TensorFlow was developed, its main dynamic memory allocation algorithm for GPU use is the \texttt{BFCAllocator}. In its own source code, \texttt{BFCAllocator} is described to be: "\textit{a memory allocator that implements a 'best-fit with coalescing' algorithm.  [...] [It] is essentially a very simple version of Doug Lea's malloc (dlmalloc) \cite{dlmalloc}"}.

CUDA's own dynamic memory allocator, \texttt{CUDAMalloc}, is kept as an easy selectable alternative, before running TensorFlow. It is however composed of proprietary code and does not share anything else but the header file that only allows it to be used. As such, we cannot investigate the code to see what type of allocator this is. However, \citeauthor{Vinkler2015} states that \texttt{CUDAMalloc} is relatively slow for allocations of small sized objects \cite{Vinkler2015}.

\subsubsection*{Dynamic memory allocation}

Dynamic memory allocation is a technique well-known and often used by programmers. Much of the work for improvement and research on this topic is being devoted to the context of single-core and multi-core general purpose processors \cite{YOU2015}. In comparison to static memory allocation, which happens at program compilation time and is more frequently used in programming, dynamic memory allocation brings along issues with its use, such as fragmentation and memory leaks \cite{TRAISTER199099}.

Such problems make dynamic memory allocation algorithms unsuitable for use on specific platforms, such as safety-critical embedded systems \cite{Puaut_2002}. The technique however did progress to be implemented on systems other than GPUs. GPUs introduce new difficulties in implementing dynamic memory allocation, being many-core systems running many more threads, distributed on many more cores than general purpose processors usually have. GPUs however evolved to be used for more than just rendering images, being used for complex programming techniques such as \textit{machine learning}. This makes dynamic memory allocation important in the context of GPUs, in order to attain efficiency for such applications.

\subsubsection*{Selected allocators}

In this section, we discuss \textit{BFCMalloc} and \textit{CUDAMalloc}, the two allocators already integrated in Tensorflow, together with our allocator of choice, \textit{Halloc}, to be integrated in the Tensorflow code and in our tests.

\textbf{BFCMalloc:} Best-fit with coalescing allocator algorithm. Finds a best fit free space by keeping a list of free space chunks grouped by power of 2 sizes in different bins (linked lists).
[To be expanded]

\textbf{CUDAMalloc:} Proprietary algorithm of NVIDIA. Does not have a description of its internals written publicly, but it is used in some of the more open memory allocation algorithms in some situations (such as \texttt{Halloc} when allocating bigger sizes).
[To be expanded]

\textbf{Halloc:} Uses a hashing function for small object sizes requested for allocation,to be reduce the cost of memory allocations for small objects. For allocations over $\sim3000$ bytes, it uses the standard \texttt{CUDAMalloc} for allocation.

%Different programming languages offer different ways of managing variables. Most of them use a dynamic memory allocation algorithm. This algorithm returns a memory address when request to create a new variable is executed. In higher level programming languages there is no direct interaction with the memory addresses, but in lower level languages programmers can employ advanced techniques to manage the memory more efficiently for a specific application \cite{TRAISTER199099}.

\subsection{Research questions}
\label{sec:questions}

We decide to tackle allocation algorithms running on GPUs because machine learning takes advantage of their multiple core setup, threading capabilities and single-instruction multiple-data (SIMD) type of computation, achieving more than average performance than running on general purpose processors. TensorFlow already implements \texttt{CUDAMalloc} and \texttt{BFCMalloc} as its two selectable options for GPU method of allocation, with the latter being the default. In our initial comparison, \texttt{CUDAMalloc} achieves ${\sim}$\resnettimecuda images/second performance when running the ResNet-50 benchmark, while BFCMalloc attains ${\sim}$\resnettimebfc images/second, showing that, in fact, dynamic memory allocation algorithms can have an impact on the overall performance of machine learning software.

Our main metric for comparison is, indeed, the speed of the construction of the ResNet-50 model that the benchmark can attain, expressed in \textit{images/second}. It is the main output that the benchmark shows while executing. Additionally, we study the object sizes being allocated throughout the runtime of the benchmark, in order to discuss why some allocators can perform better or worse for certain object sizes are requested for allocation. Furthermore, we consider of interest to change the model sizes wanted to be constructed by the benchmark, as some allocators can prove to be better with memory management than with other factors, successfully obtaining bigger models than its counterparts -- which could interrupt inadvertently when required to construct bigger models.\todo[inline]{We could also try other models}



% \textbf{\textit{Maybe this book can be cited somewhere:}} \cite{GINSBURG2017345} \\

% CUDA offers, to programmers who want to take advantage of GPU's processing power, a proprietary, unpublished algorithm for dynamically allocating memory called \texttt{CudaMalloc}. However, dynamic memory allocation algorithms running on the CPU are often customized for certain programs that require the edge in speed or stability, such as video games, database engines and so on. It is only natural to suspect that Machine Learning algorithms would be able to deliver faster performances if an allocator tailored for their needs would be selected as well.

% We believe that \texttt{CudaMalloc}, as a general purpose dynamic memory allocation algorithm for the GPU, can be replaced for better performances when using the TensorFlow \cite{abadi2016} library for Machine Learning processing. In particular the ResNet-50 implementation of TensorFlow will be evaluated, which is a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with many layers and will therefore allocate many small sized objects in the GPU memory \cite{DBLP:HeZRS15}.
% Algorithms that possibly perform better are mentioned in the work of \citeauthor{Vinkler2015} \cite{Vinkler2015}. They state that \texttt{CudaMalloc} is slower to process than other allocation algorithms for allocating many small sized objects, as shown in Figure 3a in \cite{Vinkler2015}. We decide to therefore select the better allocation algorithm for the task at hand, through the proposed research.

\item the reliability of the allocators as the size of the model is raised (does the allocator not have enough memory at some point, due to poor memory management?);

\section{Methods}
\label{sec:methods}

%\todo{Describe and explain the research methods that will be used for the project. What research method (or methods) will be used? Argue: why this is the most appropriate method or methods. For example:}

The methodology of our study is as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\vspace{-5px}
\itemsep-0.25em
    \item Analyze memory allocation pattern of ResNet-50
    \item Match pattern to memory allocator suggested by literature (\texttt{Halloc})
    \item Add \texttt{Halloc} allocator to TensorFlow source code
    \item Used standard benchmarks from TensorFlow to evaluate the performance compared to the built-in memory allocators (\texttt{BFCMalloc},\texttt{CUDAMalloc})
    \item Analyze performance of allocator for a larger variety of models
\vspace{-5px}
\end{enumerate}

We used the NVIDIA visual profiler to gain insight in the memory allocation pattern of ResNet-50. We then studied the literature to find GPU memory allocation algorithms that were likely to perform well on this specific memory allocation pattern. From this literature study the \texttt{Halloc} algorithm was the most promissing. We located the appropriate sections of code in the huge code base of TensorFlow and integrated the open source \texttt{Halloc} implementation\footnote{available from \url{https://github.com/canonizer/halloc}}.

\subsection*{Benchmarking Methods}

We will compile TensorFlow on Erik Wouters' HP ZBook workstation laptop (equipped with an NVIDIA K1100M GPU) and run the TensorFlow Convolutional Neural Network benchmarks from \url{https://github.com/TensorFlow/benchmarks}. To compare the different memory algorithms, we will repeat the compilation and benchmarking with a subset of the memory allocation algorithms described by \citeauthor{Vinkler2015} \cite{Vinkler2015}.

The project uses the empirical method \cite{bock2001}. As we evaluate using a well known benchmark from the Machine Learning field, this provides results that mimic real world performance of these algorithms applied to Machine Learning \cite{abadi2016}. In order to create results that are as repeatable as possible, each test was run 5 times and then the times were averaged together. The NVIDIA K1100M GPU will run in it's default state on Erik Wouters' HP ZBook. For were done and then the next 100 steps were averaged.

\section{Results and Analysis}
\label{sec:results-and-analysis}

In our initial comparisons, we have found TensorFlow's default allocator, \texttt{BFCAllocator}, to attain \resnettimebfc images per second when processing the ResNet-50 model benchmark, while \texttt{CUDAMalloc} attains only \resnettimecuda images per second. This proves that there is significance in such a research, as choosing the right dynamic memory allocator can have a large impact on the performance of high end algorithms and computing techniques.

The initial benchmarks are shown in table \ref{tab:results}. The images/sec column shows the average amount of images that are processed per second for the different models and allocators.

Figure \ref{fig:hist} shows a histogram of the requested object sizes (simulation). It can be observed that the bulk of the memory requests consist of small allocations which benefit from a dynamic memory allocator.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
Initial tests have shown that profiling GPU accelerated sessions in TensorFlow takes a lot of compute time. Compiling TensorFlow takes about two hours on the workstation that is used for benchmarking. The full benchmark as it is run on the website of TensorFlow cannot be run on the NVIDIA K1100M GPU, as it will run out of memory. Decreasing the batch size from 32 to 16 fixes this problem.

The ResNet-50 benchmark in its standard form (with batch size 16) takes about 5.5 minutes to run. The full benchmark runs 110 iterations including the warm-up. To run only a single iteration using the NVIDIA Visual Profiler takes 17 hours. It is therefore not feasible to run the full benchmark (with 110 iterations) with the Visual Profiler. However profiling a single iteration provides enough insight in the memory allocation pattern for further analysis.

It is relevant to state that this field is rapidly developing. There are many versions of software packages available and the combinations of all these versions may have an impact on the performance. Since we have frozen the versions of the software we use three of the packages have released new versions. The biggest version issue we experienced is related to the GPUs compute capability, which is lower than recommended by TensorFlow.
