\section{Introduction}
Many examples of real-life scenarios show how machine learning directly impacts people's day-to-day lives, such as in the application domains of: smart farming\todo[inline]{[1 TODO]}, city vehicle traffic\todo[inline]{[2 TODO]}, video surveillance and so on. 

It is therefore important to improve such complex computer techniques, by improving the basic computer algorithms on which these advanced techniques are based upon. One such basic technique is dynamic memory allocation.

\textbf{About Tensorflow:} by interchanging with the ones that are already implemented in the well-known machine learning (ML) software library TensorFlow

\section{Theoretical framework}

\textbf{About CUDAMalloc:} As such, we cannot say what type of allocator \texttt{cuMalloc} is -- as different allocator algorithms can be categorized in different types.
